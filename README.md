# 100 Days of Python

This repo follows the 100 Days of Python curriculum from Angela Yu. While I've been coding in Python since 2012, much of my work was focused on one-off Data Science projects and did not necessitate the use of 'best practices' because scripts were generally not used repeatably. At J2, the majority of my work was in dbt, so this course was a perfect way to get the rust off my Python skills and learn best (or at least better) practices.

I restarted the program completely to make sure I didn't forget anything (e.g., in the last year, I completely forgot how the `tkinter` module worked), but generally skipped assignments that I had [previously completed](https://github.com/tainari/100_days_of_python_old/tree/main) if I already felt confident in the concepts AND I didn't think it would be fun to recreate them. 

## Beginner Projects

Used these projects as a re-warmup and focused only on the parameters of the assignments - in many cases, this includes excluding e.g. input checks and additional requirements. 
May get back to these later! They are all lumped together because they're fairly simple scripts.

## Intermediate Projects
###  Day 16: Coffee Machine ☕️
A text-based reminder of proper class creation. My [older version of this project](https://github.com/tainari/100_days_of_python_old/tree/main/Day%2016) used a greedy algorithm to check if the machine had enough coins to make proper change (just for fun) - I did not reimplement here.

### Day 17: Quiz Project 🤔
A text-based true/false quiz.

### Day 18: Fine Art Generator 🎨
Turtle-based program that makes art like Damien Hirst's.

### Day 19: Etch-a-Sketch app 🖊️
Turtle-based program for drawing to your heart's desire.

### Day 20 & 21: Snake Game 🐍
Reviving the fabulous Nokie phone game of Snake. Additional implementation of high score. In future, may add a scoreboard.

### Day 22: Pong Game 🏓
Another throwback: local multiplayer Pong, built using tkinter. Player 1 uses WASD, Player 2 uses arrow keys.

### Day 23: Turtle Crossing 🐢
A simplified Frogger dupe, with extremely fancy car graphics.

### Day 24: Mail Merge ✉️
Very simple mail merge script.

### Day 25: US States Game 🇺🇸
GUI-based game built in tkinter that tests if a user can name all 50 US states. To my embarrassment, my high score is about 39. (In my defense, I'm not American. :) )

### Day 26: NATO Alphabet translator 🔠
Silly text-based thing.

### Day 27: Mile <> Kilometer Conversion 🧮
A tkinter-based converter. Rather than leaving it strictly miles to kilometers, I implemented a dropdown allowing the user to decide if they want to convert mi -> km or km -> mi.


### Days 28-30
I skipped redoing these because they were not interesting enough to warrant redoing, since I didn't need to refresh any skills from them.

### Day 31: Language Flashcard Project 🇨🇦🇫🇷
A tkinter-based flashcard app to test your knowledge of French!

### Day 32: Automatic Birthday Wisher 🎂
A script to automatically wish folks a happy birthday based on a spreadsheet of their birthdays and emails.

## Intermediate+ Projects
### Day 33: ISS Notifier 👩‍🚀
A script that leverages an API tracking the location of the ISS; it sends an email when it's night and the ISS is above your coordinates!

### Day 34: Quiz Game, GUI Edition 🧐
Updating the quiz game to have a tkinter-based user interface that reads directly from a quiz question API.

### Day 35: Weather Forecast ☔️
Using the OpenWeather API to send an email notification if it's going to rain that day; I'm really bad at remembering to pack an umbrella.

### Day 36: Stock Trend News Alert 📈
Leverages alphavantage.co and newsapi.org APIs to send an email alert with recent headlines if a stock of choice has a >5% change in its price from yesterday to the day before.

### Day 37: Pixela Graph 📊
Introduction to post, put, and delete in working with APIs.

### Day 38: Workout Tracker 🏃🏻‍♀️
Using Nutritionix and Sheetly to create a workout logger.

### Day 39: Personal Flight Deal Tracker ✈️
Using the Sheety and Amadeus flight info APIs to set low-price alerts for flights between NYC and some places of interest :) 

### Day 40: Expanded Flight Deal Tracker 🛫
Expand on Day 39 to allow users to create their own flight alerts.

### Day 41-42: Intro to HTML
Skipped because I learned all the basics of HTML during the days of GeoCities. My Neopets plushie gallery was unparalleled.
